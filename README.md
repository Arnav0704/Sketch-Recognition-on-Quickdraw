# Sketch Recognition On Quickdraw

**This project implements and evaluates several deep learning architectures for the task of sketch recognition. It provides a framework to compare models based on different approaches, including sequence-based (CNN-LSTM), modern convolutional networks (ConvNeXt), classic CNNs enhanced with specialized layers (ResNet50), and MLP-based architectures (SketchMLP).**

## üß† Models Implemented

This repository includes implementations based on the following papers:

1.  **CNN-LSTM:** Processes sketches as sequences of points, combining CNNs for local feature extraction and LSTMs for temporal dependencies.
    * *Paper:* Kim, Y., & Lee, H. (2019). Stroke-based Sketch Recognition with CNN and LSTM. *International Journal of Contents*, 15(4), 8-14.
    * *DOI:* [10.5392/IJoC.2019.15.4.008](https://doi.org/10.5392/IJoC.2019.15.4.008)
    * *Type:* Sequence-based (Vector)

2.  **ConvNeXt:** A modern, pure convolutional network architecture inspired by Vision Transformers, adapted for sketch recognition (likely treats sketches as raster images).
    * *Paper:* Liu, Z., Mao, H., Wu, C. Y., Feichtenhofer, C., Darrell, T., & Xie, S. (2022). A ConvNet for the 2020s. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.03545*. (Implementation might be based on adapting the general ConvNeXt architecture for sketch data).
    * *arXiv:* [2201.03545](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545)
    * *Type:* Image-based (Raster)

3.  **SketchMLP-S2:** An MLP-based architecture specifically designed for sketch data, potentially focusing on sequence processing.
    * *Paper:* Lin, J., & Li, J. (2021). SketchMLP: An MLP-based Architecture for Sketch Recognition. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.07477*.
    * *arXiv:* [2106.07477](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07477)
    * *Type:* Image-based (Raster)
      
4.  **ResNet50:** Uses a ResNet50 backbone.
    * *Type:* Image-based (Raster)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overviews


## **In Summary:**

* For **highest accuracy on static sketch classification**, **ConvNeXt** or **SketchMLP-S2** are likely strong contenders.
* For tasks needing **stroke order/dynamics**, **CNN-LSTM** or potentially **SketchMLP-S2** (if sequence-based) are suitable.
* For **speed/efficiency**, **SketchMLP-S2** might be the best choice, depending on its specific performance.
